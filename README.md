This is a project for my CSCE 315 class. It is hosted through Texas A&M University.<br><br>
I have decided to build it using React with Gatsby because I am familiar with React and Gatsby makes building static webpages easier. Some of the code was generated using the default Gatsby template, and then I added stuff and built on top of it.<br><br>
Here are my [plans/specifications](/design/DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md) if you are interested.
