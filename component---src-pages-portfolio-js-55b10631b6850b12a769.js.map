I got eighty users on it by just telling a few friends to spread the word.<br/><br/>\r\n    I then joined <a href='https://engineering.tamu.edu/student-life/eep/engineering-incubator/index.html'>Engineering Inc.</a> and met two people who were working on the same idea, but as an app. Eager to learn app development and work with others on this project, we teamed up and created College Cove.
