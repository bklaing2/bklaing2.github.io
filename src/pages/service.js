    <h4>I am an <a href='https://www.scouting.org/'>Eagle Scout</a></h4>
    For my Eagle Scout project, I renovated a room for my local <a href='https://nationalcasagal.org/'>CASA</a> program. CASA provides supervised visitation for children who may not be able to live with their parents and a safe and comfortable place for children to wait for parents.<br/><br/>
    The room I renovated was a waiting room for teenagers. I repainted all the walls and replaced all the furniture. I also added a TV and donated an air-hockey table that I hadnâ€™t used in a while.

    <h4><a href='https://bigevent.tamu.edu/'>The Big Event</a> is a day where college students volunteer to help around the community</h4>
    The first year I participated my group cleaned up a yard for a local family. We raked the yard and planted a variety of plants.<br/><br/>
    I am proud to say that the tamusic club is signed up for the Big Event this year!
